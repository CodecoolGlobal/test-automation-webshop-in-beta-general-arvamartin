Project Status Report

Project Title: Webshop in Beta
Report Date: August 22, 2024
Prepared By: CodeCrackers

Summary:
The Webshop project is currently in the Beta stage and is progressing well. All 14 test cases have been successfully executed across Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. However, a critical bug has been identified in the Checkout feature, where the form accepts and processes incorrect data, allowing users to complete the checkout process with invalid information. The overall state of the application is stable except for this issue. The lack of a registration feature is still a gap that needs addressing before the product can go live.

Achievements/Completed Work:

Executed 14 test cases across Firefox, Chrome, and Edge, with all tests passing except for the Checkout issue.
No other bugs were found during testing.
Verified cross-browser compatibility and stability.

In Progress:

Investigating and fixing the bug in the Checkout feature where incorrect data is being accepted.
Gathering requirements and planning for the development of the registration feature.

Next Steps/Planned Work:

Resolve the Checkout form bug to ensure it validates and processes data correctly.
Develop and integrate the registration page/section.
Perform testing on the registration feature once it is implemented.
Conduct final regression testing to ensure all features work together seamlessly and that the Checkout bug is fixed.

Issues and Risks:

Issue: Checkout form accepts incorrect data, allowing users to complete transactions with invalid information.
Action: Immediate attention required to fix the validation and data processing in the Checkout feature.
Risk: The absence of a registration feature and the Checkout bug may delay the go-live date.
Action: Prioritize fixing the Checkout issue and developing the registration page to ensure the product can be launched on schedule.

Timeline/Deadline:

The project timeline is affected by the need to fix the Checkout bug and implement the registration feature. Adjusted timelines will be defined once the fixes are in place.

Budget Status:
