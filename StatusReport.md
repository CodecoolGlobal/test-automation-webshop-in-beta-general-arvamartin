Project Status Report

Project Title: Webshop in Beta
Report Date: August 22, 2024
Prepared By: CodeCrackers

Summary:
The Webshop project is currently in the Beta stage and is progressing well. All 14 test cases have been successfully executed across three different browsers—Firefox, Chrome, and Edge—with no bugs identified. The overall state of the application is stable and nearly ready for production. However, the lack of a registration feature is a significant gap that needs to be addressed before the product can go live.

Achievements/Completed Work:
Executed 14 test cases across Firefox, Chrome, and Edge, all of which passed successfully.
No bugs were found during testing.
Verified cross-browser compatibility and stability.
In Progress:
Gathering requirements and planning for the development of the registration feature.
Next Steps/Planned Work:
Develop and integrate the registration page/section.
Perform testing on the registration feature once it is implemented.
Conduct final regression testing to ensure all features work together seamlessly.
Issues and Risks:
Risk: The absence of a registration feature may delay the go-live date if not developed in a timely manner.
Action: Prioritize the development of the registration page to ensure the product can be launched on schedule.
Timeline/Deadline:
The project is on track, but the addition of the registration feature is critical for the final release. Timelines for this task will be defined after the planning phase.
Budget Status:
